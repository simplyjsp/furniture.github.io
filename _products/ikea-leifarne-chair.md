IKEA’s Leifarne chair is cute, sleek, and perfect for a desk or the kitchen. It’s a simple yellow chair made of plastic and metal. The seat is comfortable because it has a scooped back that shapes to the owner’s needs.

The legs are re-adjustable so anyone can sit in this chair. It is also a great chair for storage. The chairs stacked on each other so it doesn’t take much space. The product is also sometimes made of recyclable materials, so when it wears down, it may be reusable.

Plus, it is very easy to assemble. Even though this chair looks plain on the outside, it’s something extraordinaryd. Between it’s fun and funky color and its flexibility, this chair will push owners outside of their boundaries - in a good way! It’s light, fun, and affordable at $49.99.
